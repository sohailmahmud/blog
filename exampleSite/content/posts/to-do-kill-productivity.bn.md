#### To-do lists may hurt our productivity than we think. Here's why.

Creating a to-do list and crossing items off it may feel satisfying, but it's actually a terrible way to prioritise tasks and get things done.  
That's according to productivity expert, author and lecturer Nir Eyal, who [told The Next Web](https://thenextweb.com/growth-quarters/2020/10/13/throw-out-your-shitty-to-do-list-heres-what-to-do-instead/):  
"I don’t think people realize how harmful this method is for productivity." He explained that, often, those with to-do lists bypass important or complicated tasks, instead focusing on those that are easier to complete. Eyal suggests people use their calendars to block out chunks of time for specific tasks, arguing that we perform better under time constraints.  
Guilty as charged! I'm an avid to-do lister. Does it help me remember the tasks I need to get done? Yes, absolutely. But does it help me to prioritise my time and actually get them done? Nope.

As this article suggests is common, I often find I navigate to the smaller tasks first, in order to get them ticked off. Really, I should probably be focusing on some of the bigger projects first.  

I've often said I'll try the approach of blocking time out in my calendar for specific tasks, in order to give them my full attention and to set myself an (albeit artificial) deadline, but I've never really done it, or stuck to working in this way.  

Maybe today's the day. I just have a couple of things to tick off my list first …
