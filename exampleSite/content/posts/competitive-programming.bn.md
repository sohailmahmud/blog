### Competition programming is a skill which most of the companies look for inorder to assess a candidate‚Äôs problem solving ability!

###### Bored of such stuff?üòí  

![Competitive Programming](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*4JvvxmEJZg_k2LvTDbJEJA.jpeg "The Complete Reference to Competitive Programming")  

### Let‚Äôs Deep dive into how it can be useful and strategies to master it!‚ö°  


**Pick a language of your choice-Java or C++ or Python!If you have picked C++, Make sure you know some of the popular STL functions and how to use it!If you have picked Java, Be familiar with Collections Framework and all the interfaces, classes and popular functions used. Python is much slower than Java and C++. I would advise you to start with Java or C++.**  

###### Are you scared of pointers and feel it‚Äôs difficult to understand and implement ?ü§ê  

###### üî•You can learn Java as it really simple and does not have any complicated concepts like pointers and operator overloading and much more!

###### This is another good resource to get in-depth knowledge in Java!  

Please don‚Äôt start with a random problem on Hackerank or Hackerearth. Sometimes even easy level of problems need some pre-requisites like topics from number theory which might include primality test, finding number of factors optimally, Euler totient, sieve of earsthosthenes, segemented sieve etc.

Firstly,read up how to find time complexity of a algorithm!  
Remember the order of increasing time complexities as you are a beginner.

Start your journey with basic sorting Algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, heap sort, quick sort, counting sort, shell sort on geeksforgeeks. Analyze all the sorting techniques and their time and space complexity.  

Do not memorize the solutions of these problems.Just analyze and remember the approach!
You don‚Äôt have to know all the algorithms before getting started with Competitive programming!
We get to know about algorithms eventually as we solve the problem!  

You might get demotivated as you might not be able to solve any problem on your own!
Don‚Äôt worry!Pick a problem with easy tag on Leetcode now and start completing atleast 30 problems of easy level. This will give you a good start to solve the next level of problems i.e. Medium level.  

Where do I get in-depth video solutions to Leetcode problems ?

When you get stuck with any problem, refer the discussion‚Äôs forum on Leetcode and it has numerous editorials!You will definitely be able to understand the solutions posted there.
