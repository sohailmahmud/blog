###### Hello DevCommunity!  
I have just finished every project of the last certificate on freeCodeCamp and got the desired Full Stack Certification. It took me nearly a year to complete every certificate, life got in the way but I finally made it!  

As I have finished the whole curriculum, I will tell you what I think of it.  

**Note:** I am not affiliated with freeCodeCamp, I‚Äôm just telling you my personal opinion on this platform.  


### What is freeCodeCamp?  
In case you were living under a rock or are new around here: freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization which has an online web platform where you can learn to code by doing small ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù, each one with a small text explaining a line of code and asking you to implement it on the platform. You run test cases and if you pass them, you are allowed to continue to the next challenge.  
![Intro freeCodeCamp](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*PCMCwj6ZPK4ZAKgDAA3kag.png "freeCodeCamp Introduction")  

The best part of fCC is that you can learn on your own without paying anything, as it is completely free (but you can make donations if you want). It is also [open source](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp), and they always need help!  

### Content
freeCodeCamp‚Äôs curriculum offers six certifications which take you around 300 hours each to earn while doing challenges and coding your own projects. If that is not enough for you, you are given an additional certification: ‚ÄúFull Stack‚Äù, as a reward for completing the previous six.  

And that‚Äôs not all: you have a last section called ‚ÄúCoding Interview Prep‚Äù which offers to teach you algorithms, data structures and gives you more projects to continue practicing!

**_Look at all that content!_**  

Every certificate finishes with five projects you have to complete by following user stories. If you manage to do them all, you are rewarded with a certification you can print or add to you LinkedIn‚Äôs profile!  

If you find a challenge too difficult, freeCodeCamp‚Äôs offers you a hint or the possibility to ask for help in the forum, which is really convenient!  

## Certifications üìú  

###### Now I will tell you about every certification in freeCodeCamp and my experience with them.

### Responsive Web Design Certification  

This is the first and most accessible certification of all and the place to start if you have no experience in programming. Here you will learn HTML5 and CSS3 to the degree of making basic but full responsive web pages.  

I had a bit of experience with HTML when I started fCC and as CSS had always been a mystery for me I started here. The platform explains in a very simple way how a tag works and how you can combine them with CSS to make basic web pages. CSS will be your only challenge here, and can take you some time to get the grasp of it, but nothing too difficult.  

The projects you have to make are very simple but engaging. I have to admit though, that I found them too simple that I got bored and did the minimum amount of effort just to continue to the next one, but I have friends who enjoyed them a lot:  

* __Build a Tribute Page:__ It can be about a famous person or something you love. You can check my project [here](https://codepen.io/sohailmahmud/pen/vYOdGXM).  
* Build a Survey Form: Like the ones you complete when registering on a site. Check mine here.  
* __Build a Product Landing Page:__ A page similar to the ones that try to sell you a specific product. Here it is.  
* __Build a Technical Documentation Page:__ Similar to a Wiki. I had no idea of what I could write here so I just copied the theme in the example and later turned it into a React Tutorial (which I have just discovered has a small bug, sorry for that)! Check mine here.  
* __Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage:__ This portfolio is filled with the four previous projects you‚Äôve made, so you can see how much you‚Äôve learned! Check out here.  

I really enjoyed the experience of this certificate and would recommend it to anyone starting in web development.
