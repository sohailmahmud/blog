#### Listening is a crucial workplace skill. Experts have these tips to improve.

Building strong relationships — at work and beyond — largely comes down to how we listen to others. And while not all of us are naturally gifted listeners, we can improve with practice. UC Santa Barbara psychology professor [Tania Israel recommends we break the process down into three core steps](https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-listen-really-listen-to-someone-you-dont-agree-with/). To start with, we can pay active, silent attention to what others are saying. Next, we can repeat what we have heard in our own words, making sure we understand what's been said (even if we don't agree). And finally, we can ask open-ended questions, the kind that can't be answered with a yes or no and demonstrate that we are processing what we've heard.
