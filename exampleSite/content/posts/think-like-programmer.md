### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
![How to think like a programmer](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*HTRqXgr7CVtRBsyTxurQew.jpeg)  

#### If you’re interested in programming, you may well have seen this quote before:  
> “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” - Steve Jobs

You probably also wondered what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it??  

Essentially, it’s all about __a more effective way for problem solving.__  

In this post, my goal is to teach you that way.  

By the end of it, you’ll know exactly what steps to take to be a better problem-solver.  

### Why is this important?  

###### Problem solving is the meta-skill.

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.  

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):  

* Try a solution.
* If that doesn’t work, try another one.
* If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.  

The best way involves a) having a framework and b) __practicing it.__

> __“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.__  

> __Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for… more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.__  

> __Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank ([2018 Developer Skills Report](https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/))__  


### Have a framework

__To find the right framework, I followed the advice in Tim Ferriss’ book on learning, "[The 4-Hour Chef](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0547884591/?tag=richardreeze-20)".__  

It led me to interview two really impressive people: C. Jordan Ball (ranked 1st or 2nd out of 65,000+ users on Coderbyte), and V. Anton Spraul (author of the book “Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving”).
