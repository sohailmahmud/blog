### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
![How to think like a programmer](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*HTRqXgr7CVtRBsyTxurQew.jpeg)  

#### If you’re interested in programming, you may well have seen this quote before:  
> “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” - Steve Jobs

You probably also wondered what does it mean, exactly, to think like a programmer? And how do you do it??  

Essentially, it’s all about __a more effective way for problem solving.__  

In this post, my goal is to teach you that way.  

By the end of it, you’ll know exactly what steps to take to be a better problem-solver.  

### Why is this important?  

###### Problem solving is the meta-skill.

We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.  

Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):  

* Try a solution.
* If that doesn’t work, try another one.
* If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

Look, sometimes you luck out. But that is the worst way to solve problems! And it’s a huge, huge waste of time.  

The best way involves a) having a framework and b) __practicing it.__

> __“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.__  

> __Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for… more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.__  

> __Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank ([2018 Developer Skills Report](https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/))__  


### Have a framework

__To find the right framework, I followed the advice in Tim Ferriss’ book on learning, "[The 4-Hour Chef](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0547884591/?tag=richardreeze-20)".__  

It led me to interview two really impressive people: [C. Jordan Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjordanball/) (ranked 1st or 2nd out of 65,000+ users on [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/)), and V. Anton Spraul (author of the book “[Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593274246/?tag=richardreeze-20)).  

I asked them the same questions, and guess what? Their answers were pretty similar!  

Soon, you too will know them.  

Sidenote: this doesn’t mean they did everything the same way. Everyone is different. You’ll be different. But if you start with principles we all agree are good, you’ll get a lot further a lot quicker.

###### So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

### Here are the steps:  

#### 1. Understand
Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).  

How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.  

Do you remember being stuck on a problem, you start explaining it, and you instantly see holes in the logic you didn’t see before?  

Most programmers know this feeling.  

This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it (or thing… some people use a [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)).

#### 2. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!  

Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.  

In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.  

###### To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”  

Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!  

#### 3. Divide
Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.  

Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.  

Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.  

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).  

After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.  

Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.  

Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem.    Congratulations!  

This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).  

> “If I could teach every beginning programmer one problem-solving skill, it would be the ‘reduce the problem technique.’  

> For example, suppose you’re a new programmer and you’re asked to write a program that reads ten numbers and figures out which number is the third highest. For a brand-new programmer, that can be a tough assignment, even though it only requires basic programming syntax.  

> If you’re stuck, you should reduce the problem to something simpler. Instead of the third-highest number, what about finding the highest overall? Still too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the larger of two?  

> Reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match, and keep going until you are back where you started.” — V. Anton Spraul  

#### 4. Stuck?
By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking “Hey Richard... That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??”  

First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.  

Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!  

The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.  

In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:
